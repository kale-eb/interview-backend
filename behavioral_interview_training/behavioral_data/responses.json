    "prompt": "Can you share a specific experience where you had to collaborate with a diverse group of individuals who had differing opinions or work styles? How did you navigate those differences to achieve a common goal, and what was the outcome of that collaboration?",
    "main_response": "Yeah, this actually reminds me of a group project I did for my Human-Centered Design class. Our team had four people, and we were all pretty different in how we approached work. One person was super design-focused\u2014like really passionate about UI/UX details\u2014and another was all about functionality and fast iteration. I was somewhere in the middle, trying to balance both. The main conflict started when we were deciding how polished our prototype needed to be for the final presentation. The design person wanted to spend a bunch of time refining the visuals, but the other person felt like that was a waste and kept pushing to just focus on getting it working. Meetings got kind of tense, and people were talking over each other or tuning out completely.\nI tried to step in more as a moderator, even though I wasn\u2019t officially the team lead. I set up a shared doc where we listed out the requirements and broke them into \u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice-to-haves,\u201d so we could align on priorities. I also suggested we set timeboxes\u2014like, give the designer a few hours to polish the homepage, and then pivot to finishing the backend logic. That way, everyone felt heard and we stayed on schedule.In the end, we finished a prototype that looked clean and actually worked. The presentation went well, and I think what I learned was that you don\u2019t need everyone to work the same way\u2014you just need to find a structure that respects their strengths while keeping things grounded in the end goal. It also made me realize how helpful it is to put things in writing when there\u2019s disagreement. Having shared notes and task lists helped us stay aligned even when we didn\u2019t agree on everything.",
    "followup_response": "Yeah, there was a meeting about a week before our final presentation where things got really tense\u2014the designer wanted to redo the onboarding flow because it didn\u2019t feel smooth enough, but the backend teammate was visibly annoyed and said something like, \u201cWhy are we spending time on stuff that doesn\u2019t matter if it doesn\u2019t even work?\u201d and it felt like the whole conversation was about to spiral, so I stepped in and shared my screen with our shared doc and said, \u201cLet\u2019s just break this down\u2014what\u2019s the bare minimum version that we can commit to by tomorrow night?\u201d and once we listed that out, I said, \u201cIf we hit that, then we can use any leftover time to polish,\u201d and they both actually agreed right away, which kind of surprised me but also showed that having a neutral process to focus on helped shift the energy, and from that I realized that a lot of conflict isn\u2019t about people being difficult\u2014it\u2019s about not having a shared framework for moving forward, so now when I sense that\ntension I try to immediately ground it in priorities and timelines everyone can see.",

    "main_response": "Yeah, I set a goal last summer to finish building this personal finance app I started during the school year\u2014I wanted to launch a beta version by the end of August and maybe even let friends try it, so I created a roadmap in Notion, broke it into weekly milestones, and committed to coding at least an hour a day, but once my internship started I totally underestimated how mentally drained I\u2019d be after work, and on top of that I was also taking an online algorithms course and trying to stay active socially, so I kept pushing the project off thinking I\u2019d catch up later, and by mid-August I realized there was no way I\u2019d finish it on time, which honestly felt like a letdown because I had talked about it a lot and felt like I was falling behind my own expectations\u2014but I ended up reframing it by doing a short reflection doc where I wrote out what went wrong, and I realized the issue wasn\u2019t motivation, it was overcommitting without clear fallback plans, so since then I\u2019ve tried to set softer deadlines\nfor side projects and prioritize based on energy, not just ambition.",
    "followup_response": "Yeah, so in the reflection doc I made a simple three-part structure: first I listed what I originally planned and why I thought it mattered, then I wrote out all the things that got in the way\u2014like specific dates where I skipped progress, why I skipped, and what I was doing instead\u2014and finally I asked myself what I could\u2019ve changed without burning out, and from that I realized I needed to plan around energy levels not just time blocks, so for my next project\u2014a Discord bot I built for my study group\u2014I set super low-pressure goals like \u201ccode one small feature per weekend,\u201d and I gave myself two full months instead of a few weeks, and that slower pace actually helped me stay consistent and finish it without feeling overwhelmed.",

What role did you play in addressing the issue, how did you support your teammates during this difficult time, and what did you learn from the experience that you apply in team settings today?",
    "main_response": "Yeah, one time that stands out was during a group project in my software engineering class where we were building a budgeting web app, and about a week before the deadline one of our teammates told us they had to drop the class for personal reasons, which was a huge blow because they were handling the main dashboard feature and we hadn\u2019t touched it yet, so the rest of us had to suddenly redistribute a big chunk of work under time pressure\u2014my role was backend, but I volunteered to pick up the dashboard since I had some experience with React, and I also helped the others reorganize our Trello board and set daily check-ins just to keep everyone on the same page and not fall apart, and even though we were stressed, I kept reminding the team that if we focused on one task at a time, we could still turn in something solid,\nwhich we did\u2014the final product wasn\u2019t as polished as we\u2019d originally planned but it worked and got good feedback, and I think what I learned from that was how important it is to stay solution-focused when plans fall apart, and that small things like organizing check-ins or keeping people calm can have a huge impact on a team\u2019s ability to recover.",
    "followup_response": "Yeah, one specific challenge was figuring out how to sync the dashboard\u2019s expense graphs with the backend data in real-time because the original teammate had planned to use a different charting library than what I was familiar with, so I had to learn Chart.js from scratch in like two days while also wiring up the API calls correctly, and at first the graphs weren\u2019t updating properly when users added new entries\u2014it turned out I was missing a state update in React that prevented re-rendering, so after a few hours of debugging I fixed it by lifting the state up and using a custom hook to refetch the data on every form submission, and when I showed the working version in our next team call, people were super relieved and one of my teammates messaged me afterward saying, \u201cHonestly dude, you kept us on track when it felt like we were gonna crash,\u201d which meant a lot, and that whole experience taught me that even if you\u2019re not the most experienced person on the team, just stepping in and keeping things\nmoving can make a big difference.",

    "main_response": "Yeah, so I led a team for a student hackathon where our goal was to build a study tracker app that gamified productivity with a point system, and I took charge of organizing the timeline, assigning roles, and setting up our GitHub repo and task board, but I underestimated how much work the integration between the frontend and backend would take and didn\u2019t leave enough time for testing, so even though each part worked separately, we hit a wall the night before the demo when we realized the app kept crashing on login due to an auth bug I hadn\u2019t accounted for, and we all stayed up trying to fix it but ran out of time and had to present a demo video of disconnected features instead of a live walkthrough, which felt like a huge letdown, but after the event I sent a reflection doc to the team outlining what I learned and took full responsibility, and we did a short debrief where people shared feedback and appreciated that I owned up to the planning gaps\u2014what I took from that was that being a leader doesn\u2019t\nmean getting everything right, it means owning the outcome and making space for the team to learn and move forward even when things flop.",

    "main_response": "Yeah, during a group project in one of my CS classes, a teammate admitted in a private message that they\u2019d copied part of their code from an online source without citing it, and they asked me not to say anything because \u201ceveryone does it,\u201d but it didn\u2019t feel right to just ignore it since we were submitting as a team and our names were all on the final report, so I told them directly that I wasn\u2019t comfortable turning it in unless they either rewrote the section or disclosed it properly, and they were kind of annoyed at first and said I was overreacting, but after a day they came back and agreed to redo the function from scratch and asked me to help them understand the logic, so we worked on it together and ended up submitting something that was actually cleaner and more in line with the assignment goals\u2014honestly it was awkward, and I was worried I\u2019d make things worse in the moment, but it made me realize that saying something doesn\u2019t have to be confrontational if you keep the focus on doing\nthe right thing for the group.",
    "followup_response": "Yeah, when I messaged them I started by keeping the tone really neutral\u2014I said something like, \u201cHey, I saw what you mentioned about copying that code and I totally get that this class is stressful, but since it\u2019s a group submission I just want to be honest that I\u2019m not comfortable turning it in unless it\u2019s original or cited,\u201d and I made sure to avoid accusing them or making it personal, and instead framed it as a team issue that could affect all of us, and I also said I was happy to help walk through the logic with them if they wanted to redo it, which I think helped lower the defensiveness because I wasn\u2019t just pointing fingers\u2014I was offering support too, and that experience really shaped how I see integrity in teams now, like it\u2019s not just about doing your own part right, it\u2019s also about making sure your team is moving in the right direction together, even if it means having uncomfortable conversations.",

    "followup_response": "Yeah, one challenge was that even though I had everything blocked out, some tasks took longer than I expected\u2014like debugging the CS project ended up being more complicated because of a bug with async state updates, so it ate into my stats study time, and I started to feel behind even though I technically had a plan, so what I did was shift some of the less urgent study blocks to later in the evening and cut one of my breaks shorter, and I also decided to skip watching lecture videos at 1.5x speed and just reviewed slides and practice problems instead to save time, and what I learned is that time-blocking works best when you treat it as a flexible framework, not a rigid schedule\u2014like it gave me structure, but I had to adjust it on the fly when things changed, and that helped me stay calm instead of throwing the whole plan out when one part ran long.",

It's clear that you demonstrated some impressive behavioral traits during your bio discussion, and you should feel proud of how you stepped up in a moment of uncertainty. Let's break down a few key strengths you showcased:\n\n1. **Initiative and Leadership**: Even though you don\u2019t see yourself as a \u201cleader,\u201d you took the initiative to start writing on the whiteboard when the group was quiet. This shows that you are willing to step up when needed, which is a critical trait in any collaborative environment. Your actions encouraged your peers to contribute, transforming a stagnant discussion into an engaged one.\n\n2. **Problem-Solving**: You faced a challenge with uncertainty and self-doubt but chose to focus on what you remembered from the lecture rather than letting that overwhelm you. This demonstrates adaptability and quick thinking, which are essential skills in problem-solving.
