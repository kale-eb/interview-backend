   ```bash
   pip install openai python-dotenv
   ```

2. Configure API key:
   ```bash
   # Edit config.env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here

Complete interactive experience with all features:
```bash
python interview_cli.py
```

#### 2. Quick Training Session
Fast daily practice with GPT:
```bash
python run_trainer.py
# Select option 2
```

#### 3. Direct Module Usage
```python
from interview_trainer import BehavioralTrainingGPT

app = BehavioralTrainingGPT()
session_result = app.run_daily_session("your_user_id")
```

## üìä Scoring System

### Multi-Category Scoring (1-10 Scale)
Each response is evaluated across all 10 behavioral categories:

- **10**: Perfectly relevant - story directly demonstrates this skill
- **7-9**: Highly relevant - strong connection to the category
- **5-6**: Moderately relevant - some connection to the category
- **3-4**: Slightly relevant - minimal connection
- **1-2**: Not relevant - no meaningful connection (not recorded)

### Composite Score Calculation
```
Composite_[Category]_Score = Total of all scores for that category / 10
```

Example:
- User has 3 responses with Teamwork scores: 8, 6, 9
- Total: 8 + 6 + 9 = 23
- Composite_Teamwork_Score = 23 / 10 = 2.3

### Relevance Filtering
- Only scores ‚â• 3 are recorded for each category
- Prevents noise from irrelevant responses
- Ensures quality data for composite calculations

## üîÑ Daily Flow

1. **Load User Profile**: Retrieve current composite scores and history
2. **Identify Weakest Category**: Find area with lowest composite score
3. **Generate AI Prompt**: GPT-4o-mini creates targeted question + follow-up
4. **Capture Response**: Get user's detailed answer
5. **Multi-Category Scoring**: GPT evaluates relevance across all categories
6. **Update Profile**: Calculate new composite scores and store responses
7. **Save Data**: Store all information in structured JSON format

## üìà Progress Tracking

### Metrics Tracked
- **Total Responses**: Number of completed sessions
- **Composite Scores**: Overall performance for each category (total/10)
- **Response Counts**: Number of responses per category

- **User Authentication**: Secure user management and profiles
- **Cloud Storage**: Remote data backup and synchronization
- **Real-time Scoring**: Instant feedback during response composition

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Key Errors**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `config.env`
2. **Import Errors**: Install required packages: `pip install openai python-dotenv`
3. **File Permission Errors**: Ensure write access to `behavioral_data/` directory
4. **JSON Parsing Errors**: Check for malformed responses from GPT API
5. **Network Issues**: App falls back to template prompts if API is unavailable

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging by modifying the main functions to include debug prints.

### Fallback System
The app gracefully degrades to template prompts and simple scoring if:
- OpenAI API key is not configured
- Network connectivity issues occur
- API rate limits are exceeded
- GPT responses are malformed
